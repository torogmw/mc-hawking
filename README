MC Hawking turns text input to rap in Dr Stephen Hawking's voice automagically! You need to have Mac OSX and MaxMSP to run the program.

Open up main.maxpat and run "python udp_loop.py" from terminal. Follow the two steps in main.maxpat. You can prepare your own lyrics by creating messages in MaxMSP or change the backup music by replacing "drum_1bar.wav".

Enjoy the hilarious output!
